Documentation and resources for my Windows Server 2019 Active Directory lab environment

# Windows Server Active Directory Home Lab Project  

A hands-on learning project focused on Windows Server 2019, Active Directory Domain Services, and network troubleshooting.  

## Environment Overview  

- **Domain Controller**: Windows Server 2019 Standard  
  - Role: Primary DC for adproject.local domain  
  - Services: Active Directory DS, DNS, DHCP  
  - IP Configuration: 192.168.1.10/24  

- **Client Machine**: Windows 10 Pro  
  - Role: Domain-joined workstation  
  - IP Configuration: 192.168.1.20/24  

## Learning Objectives Achieved  

- [x] Successfully installed and configured Windows Server 2019  
- [x] Implemented Active Directory Domain Services  
- [x] Configured DNS for proper domain resolution  
- [x] Joined client to domain and verified authentication  
- [x] Troubleshot common network and domain connectivity issues  
- [x] Created technical documentation based on experiences  

## Key Troubleshooting Scenarios  

This repository focuses on the troubleshooting aspects of maintaining a Windows domain environment. Documented scenarios include:  

1. **Subnet Misconfiguration Issues**  
   - Identified symptoms when client machines are placed on incorrect subnets  
   - Developed systematic approach to diagnose and resolve connectivity problems  

2. **DNS Resolution Failures**  
   - Tested name resolution using various tools  
   - Documented the relationship between DNS and domain functionality  

3. **Domain Authentication Problems**  
   - Analyzed authentication failures and their causes  
   - Created resolution procedures for common authentication issues  

## Documentation Approach  

While this project was primarily a hands-on learning experience, I've documented the knowledge gained in a series of technical articles and troubleshooting guides available in the [knowledge-base](/knowledge-base) folder.  

## Skills Demonstrated  

- Windows Server administration  
- Active Directory configuration and management  
- Network troubleshooting methodology  
- Technical problem solving  
- IT documentation creation
